## Software Engineer

As you can see from the graphic above... [design is my passion](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/graphic-design-is-my-passion). That is to say, I see myself _primarily_ as an engineer, not a designer. I like design, and I'll do it in a pinch, but I'm happier building stuff when I don't have to worry about coming up with how it will look.

I've worked at [Braintree Payments](https://www.braintreepayments.com/) (a PayPal company) as a Software Engineer for 6+ years. My core responsibility right now is maintaining the [Braintree web SDK](https://github.com/braintree/braintree-web), but I work on a lot of other things too! I've built tools for my team, migrated the JavaScript packages to Typescript, and managed Github issues/PRs for repos in a variety of different programming languages.

I've dabbled in a bunch of frontend frameworks. My favorite system right now is the Jamstack using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)/[Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

In my free time, I maintain a bunch of open source projects on my [Github account](https://github.com/crookedneighbor).

## Dad

I've got 2 amazing kids! I'm trying hard to respect their privacy online, so I won't say more about it on here, but it felt wrong not to mention it!

## Wizard

I spend waaaaaay too much time thinking about and playing [Magic the Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/).

I recently helped redesign the website for [Commander Spellbook](https://commanderspellbook.com), a search engine for game winning card interactions for the Commander format. Despite maintaining the web infrastructure for this site, I'm more of a casual scrub than a competitive combo player.

I maintain a browser extension to amplify the Magic search engine [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com) ([source code on Github](https://github.com/crookedneighbor/shambleshark), [Chrome Version](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shambleshark-unofficial-s/dapgnadfmfhacpgpoolibbhbmbabhael), [Firefox Version](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/shambleshark/)). In addition, I help maintain Scryfall's [Tagger app](https://tagger.scryfall.com/).

Some of my favorite decks right now are:

- [<i data-emoji="ðŸŒ‹"></i> Greenless Landfall - Toggo + Silas Ren](https://scryfall.com/@blade/decks/464dd723-9247-4069-b645-e02ffb914554)
- [<i data-emoji="ðŸ¤—"></i> Monoblack Group Hug - Seizan, Perverter of Truth](https://scryfall.com/@blade/decks/3f50165a-b384-421b-87e7-0623283833db)
- [<i data-emoji="ðŸŽ¶"></i> Too Many Cards - Arjun, the Shifting Flame](https://scryfall.com/@blade/decks/cf58119c-d8ef-4d35-9b9b-b4aa0960afae)
- [<i data-emoji="ðŸŒ»"></i> 2 Power Matters - Tana + Sidar](https://scryfall.com/@blade/decks/5fb447ac-86d0-4c18-bc34-a9027f579d27)
- [<i data-emoji="ðŸ«‚"></i> Bant Clone & Populate - Sakashima + Sidar](https://scryfall.com/@blade/decks/76450de3-8f58-484d-85bb-920c1b3482ea)

Want to play a game? I love playing a game of casual Commander over [Spelltable](https://spelltable.com/).
