I've known Steve Slagg since college, and he's one of my favorite songwriters.

Steve released [a lot of great songs](https://steveslagg.bandcamp.com/album/i-dont-want-to-get-adjusted-to-this-world) this year, so it was hard to just pick one! But as the year went on, it was Outside All the Time that wormed its way into my heart; I often find myself humming it or singing it to my kids.

I got to see Steve perform several times this year, and I'm hoping for several more shows in 2025.

> With meditative care, Slagg invites us to glide through atmospheric songs about death, boredom, and beauty with an inexorable surge â€“ perhaps like the mighty Mississippi. While Slagg paints with broad, synth-oriented brushes there is a folksy sensibility here, too. Maybe it's the vivid natural imagery Slagg employs, or perhaps the breathless intimacy in ordinary moments.
