I started a new job at [Splice](https://splice.com) at the beginning of this year, after being laid off from [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) when [Epic Games sold the company to Songtradr](https://www.404media.co/bandcamps-entire-union-bargaining-team-was-laid-off/) amid contract negotations with our newly unionzed company. I had joined Bandcamp after spending about 8 years at [Braintree](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braintree_(company)>), so happy to move into a new role where I could actively work on a product that functioned to support musicians - only to be dropped from that job within a year.

Thankfully, through the generous help from a coworker I met at Bandcamp, I was able to interview for a job at Splice, where I worked under [Brian](https://bsky.app/profile/brianloveswords.com), my new grandboss - who posted this song.

> One, two, three, four
> I count mountains
> One, two, three, counter
> You're a cool thing, count mountains

The first few seconds of the song played, and I knew it would land on my 2024 playlist. I love songs that can't exist within an acoustic space, where if you were to take out the electronic aspects of them, something essential to the song would be lost.
