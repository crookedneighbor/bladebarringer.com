I had lost track of [Feist](https://listentofeist.com/) for many years, but this song made it's way into Splice's [Music League](https://musicleague.com/) for a round for folk's favorite song of 2023 and it was instantly my favorite.

The last few years, between work, caring for my family, and taking care of myself - I have not had the time I want to do creative things. I have to squirrel away time to doodle, or play music, there's just never enough to do as much as I want to do. But, all that said, as hard as it's been this year, it's also been very good. Sometimes I just need help remembering that.
