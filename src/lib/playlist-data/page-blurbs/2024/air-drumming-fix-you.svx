I didn't start getting into music until I was around 18 years old, and one of the first band's I latched onto (much to my embarassment now) was [Coldplay](https://www.coldplay.com/). I remember buying the "Rush of Blood to the Head" chord book when I was first starting to learn how to play piano and figuring out how to play "Clocks" and doing so again and again and again. I must have driven my family crazy.

Anyway, this weird song about a girl jamming out by herself to "Fix You" in a church makes me smile.

> “Air Drumming Fix You” is an warm extended poetic ramble, on that Advance Base/Casiotone For The Painfully Alone flow, and it crests with an image of someone, you guessed it, air-drumming Coldplay’s “Fix You” while sitting in a church pew. (OK, maybe you wouldn’t have guessed that last part.) It’s a gorgeous track
